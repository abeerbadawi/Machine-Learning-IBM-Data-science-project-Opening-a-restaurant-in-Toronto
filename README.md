I have been working on earning the IBM Data Science professional certificate. IBM Data Science professional is a course that teaches you how to be a data scientist besides learning the widely used tools in the data science field. To complete the course, you need to create a portfolio of data science projects, the final one is a Capstone Project. As a Capstone for the professional certification, we are asked to describe a problem, discuss its background, and collect data from online resources and location data to create a solution for an exciting problem. This blog explains my process for determining the perfect spot in Toronto, Canada to open a middle eastern restaurant. In this project, we explain all the processing steps starting by problem formulation, data preparation, methodology, and finally the analysis.
